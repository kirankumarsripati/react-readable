# Readable API Server

This is the optional project for the Udacity's Redux course where the task is to build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server provided by Udacity. The front-end portion of the project is developed using React TypeScript.

## Development

To get started developing right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, use go to front-end
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
